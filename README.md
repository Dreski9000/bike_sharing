### Overview
The goal is to analyze CitiBike trip data from August 2019 to come up with potentially useful insights for the company.

The main project can be viewed at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrey.podvysotskiy/viz/CitiBikeWorkbook_16491231724430/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes

### Results

### Summary

Other potential avenues for exploration would be to examine the starting locations and ending locations that
have the most connections between them in order to potentially predict future demand, and examine if potential 
assymetries exist between starting and ending location to ensure proper logistical systems.
